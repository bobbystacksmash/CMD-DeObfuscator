* DOS De-Obfuscator

** ABOUT

/Currently under active development/

DOS DeObfuscator is a node.js library and command-line utility
designed to remove as much CMD.EXE obfuscation as possible.  This
program is highly influenced by the "DOSfuscation" whitepaper,
published by [[https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/dosfuscation-exploring-obfuscation-and-detection-techniques.html][FireEye]].  Many of the static analysis techniques used in
DOS DeObfuscator have come from FireEye's paper.
